<h1>My Life and Times</h1>

<p>by Willard Carroll Smith</p>

<h2>The Saga Begins</h2>

<p>In West Philadelphia, born and raised. On the playground is where I spent most of my days chilling out, maxing, relaxing, all cool</p>

<h2>An Unexpected Journey</h2>

<p>I was shooting some B-Ball outside of the school when a couple of guys (they were up to no good!) started making trouble in my neighborhood.</p>

<p>I got in one little fight and my mom got scared. She said, "You're moving with your auntie and your uncle in Bel-Air."</p>
