		<h2>The Saga Begins</h2>

		<img src="ball.jpg" alt="B-ball game" />

		<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Philadelphia">West Philadelphia</a>, born and raised. On the playground is where I spent most of my days:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Chilling out</li>
			<li>Maxing</li>
			<li>Relaxing, all cool</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>An Unexpected Journey</h2>

		<p>I was shooting some B-Ball outside of the school when a couple of guys &mdash; they were up to <strong>no good!</strong> &mdash; started making trouble in my neighborhood.</p>

		<p>I got in <em>one little fight</em> and my mom got scared. She said, <q>You're moving with your auntie and your uncle in Bel-Air.</q></p>
