<h1>My Life and Times</h1>

<p>by Willard Carroll Smith</p>

<h2>The Saga Begins</h2>

<p>In West Philadelphia, born and raised. On the playground is where I spent most of my days:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Chilling out</li>
	<li>Maxing</li>
	<li>Relaxing, all cool</li>
</ul>

<h2>An Unexpected Journey</h2>

<p>I was shooting some B-Ball outside of the school when a couple of guys (they were up to <strong>no good!</strong>) started making trouble in my neighborhood.</p>

<p>I got in <em>one little fight</em> and my mom got scared. She said, <q>You're moving with your auntie and your uncle in Bel-Air.</q></p>
